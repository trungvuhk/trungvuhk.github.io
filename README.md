# Trung Vu
Hello! I am a math graduate student at Yale. My advisor is [Ivan Losev](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/).

My research interests lie in geometric representation theory and quantum algebras. I am currently using tools from quantization and Poisson geometry to study Harish-Chandra bimodules for quantum group at roots of unity.

Here is my [CV](TrungCV.pdf).
