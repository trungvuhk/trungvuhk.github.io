Hello! I am a math graduate student at Yale. My advisor is [Ivan Losev](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~il282/)

My research interests lie in geometric representation theory and quantum algebras. I am currently using tools from quantization and Poisson geometry to study Harish-Chandra bimodules for quantum group at roots of unity.

Here is my [CV](TrungCV.pdf).

# Research
- On the functor relating Harish-Chandra bimodules and Soergel bimodules, arXiv:2507.17067
- On De Concini-Kac forms of quantum groups (with I.Losev and A.Tsymbaliuk). In preparation
- Quantum Harish-Chandra bimodules at roots of unity. In progress
